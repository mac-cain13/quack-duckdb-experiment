# Quack 

macOS/iOS Swift app to play around with [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) using a [experimental DuckDB SPM package](https://github.com/mac-cain13/cduckdb-experiment).

At the moment of writing it's nothing more than the C example code from the docs implemented in Swift. See [QuackTests.swift](https://github.com/mac-cain13/quack-duckdb-experiment/blob/main/QuackTests/QuackTests.swift#L21)
